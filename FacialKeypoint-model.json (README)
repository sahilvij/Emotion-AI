"FacialKeypoint-model.json" file contains details about:
     - fitting the model using a convolutional neural network.
     - created by using the callback function 'ModelCheckpoint', which is a tensorflow function.
     - used to spot the key points at various positions on the face, such as different position of eyes and lips; nose tip.
     - generates the weights analyzed by learning the model.
     - aspects used to compile the model:
          1. optimizer : Adam
          2. loss : mean_squared_error
     - can be replicated later in other projects.
