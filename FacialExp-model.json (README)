"FacialExp-model.json" file contains details about:
     - fitting the model using a convolutional neural network.
     - created by using the callback function 'ModelCheckpoint', which is a tensorflow function.
     - detects the facial expression in the photograph.
     - aspects used to compile the model:
          1. optimizer : Adam 
          2. loss : categorical_crossentropy
     - can be replicated later in other projects.
