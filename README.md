# Emotion-AI
This artificial intelligence model is created to detect the emotions in a photograph.


The objective of this project is to predict key point positions on the face and also the emotions detected in the images.
This project consists of two different models, they are:

Determining the key points on the face, namely:
- left eye center
- right eye center
- left eye inner corner
- left eye outer corner
- right eye inner corner
- right eye outer corner
- left eyebrow inner end
- left eyebrow outer end
- right eyebrow inner end
- right eyebrow outer end
- nose tip
- mouth left corner
- mouth right corner
- mouth center top lip
- mouth center bottom lip

Detecting the expression in the photograph, namely:
- anger
- disgust
- sad
- happiness
- surprise

Combination of these models using artificial neural network and convolutional neural network with the help of residual network can accomplish these type of projects.
